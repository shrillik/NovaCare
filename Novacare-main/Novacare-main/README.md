NovaCare AI Support
Project Overview

NovaCare AI Support is an intelligent conversational AI system designed to assist users with customer support queries via text or voice input. It integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML) for intent classification, and Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities to provide seamless interaction. The system can handle routine queries autonomously while escalating complex issues to human support.

Problems Solved

Many businesses face challenges in delivering timely and consistent customer support. Common problems include:

High Volume of Repetitive Queries: Support teams spend excessive time on routine questions like order status, plan details, or cancellations.

Delayed Response Times: Users often wait long periods for responses, reducing customer satisfaction.

Limited Support Availability: Human agents cannot be available 24/7.

Lack of Personalization: Responses are often generic and fail to consider previous interactions.

Inefficient Escalation: Low-confidence queries may not be routed to human agents effectively.

NovaCare AI Support addresses these issues by:

Automating repetitive queries with high accuracy.

Providing instant responses via text or voice.

Maintaining conversation memory for personalized interactions.

Escalating complex queries automatically to human agents.

Enabling 24/7 support without additional staffing.
